# Instacity of Go:teborg

## Code Institute - Milestone Project 1

- The purpose of Instacity of Go:teborg is to introduce potential visitors to the hidden gems, scenic locations and exciting activities that can be experienced within Gothenburg; providing links to allow users to transition to other existing webpages where they can action their interests.  
Through considering this, I am ensuring that the website created will be optimised to meet the needs and wants of my target audience - encouraging repeat visitors.

## Overview

The idea has been inspired by Instagram as we're living in an increasingly digital age where the majority of users engage better with image-focused content, rather than large blocks of text.
 
## Description 

This project is a four-page website, of which the individual pages are: 'Home', 'Summer', 'Winter' and 'Sign Up'. The 'Summer' and 'Winter' pages are image-based and include minimal relevant information such as the location names, a little description and links under each image. 
The website is dedicated to Gothenburg, that is responsive on all devices. My goal for this project was to have user-friendly website that doesn't overload the visitor with big texts, where they can easily find all esential information about Gothenburg.

## Skeleton

## Surface

I wanted to use simple layout with rounded shapes to buttons, navbar elements & images and colours of Gothenburg.


### Images
- Imagery is important, especially for image-based website. The hero image at the top of the home page is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention inviting to transition to the next pages.
In the meantime, the "summer" and "winter" pages mostly consist of images.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        - Main colors of the website are - blue, yellow and white. This colourscheme is consistant throughout all pages and is matching coat of arms of Gothenburg.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Risque font used for big headings. While Raleway font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't loading. 
        Major Mono Display is easy to read and eyecatching font for the headings. Raleway is nicely spaced out and have thicknest that is perfectly matches the main headings font.
