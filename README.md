# Instacity of Go:teborg

## Code Institute - Milestone Project 1

- The purpose of Instacity of Go:teborg is to introduce potential visitors to the hidden gems, scenic locations and exciting activities that can be experienced within Gothenburg; providing links to allow users to transition to other existing webpages where they can action their interests.  
Through considering this, I am ensuring that the website created will be optimised to meet the needs and wants of my target audience - encouraging repeat visitors.

## Overview

The idea has been inspired by Instagram as we're living in an increasingly digital age where the majority of users engage better with image-focused content, rather than large blocks of text.
 
## Description 

This project is a four-page website, of which the individual pages are: 'Home', 'Summer', 'Winter' and 'Sign Up'. The 'Summer' and 'Winter' pages are image-based and include minimal relevant information such as the location names, a little description and links under each image. 
The website is dedicated to Gothenburg, that is responsive on all devices. My goal for this project was to have user-friendly website that doesn't overload the visitor with big texts, where they can easily find all esential information about Gothenburg.

## UX  

## Strategy

This website is targeting all demographics who enjoys nature and looking for unique travel destinations. Gothenburg might not be the top place tourists normally visit, however it is full of adventorous things to do and breathaking views to see in summer as well as in winter.   

**Business Goals**

- To attract more users to sign up to receive offers for activities in Gothenburg.

- To have an easy intuative way to navigate through website and finding a necessary information.

- To provide a tailored information to activities providers that will result in higher number of tourists which will bring higher income for both us and partners.

**User Stories**

#### As a First Time User:

- I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site.
- I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
- I want the content to be user-friendly with engaging visual design.

#### As a Returning User: 

- I want to find more information about the city of Gothenburg.
- I want to find out the cost for the places I wish to visit in Gothenburg.
- I want to easily find links to where I can book tickets for activities and events in Gothenburg.
- I want to find out about hot spots and pictureque places within the city.

#### As a Frequent User: 

- I want the content to remain consistent.
- I want the website's content to be regularly updated, so I can check to see if there are any new posts/pictures or locations added to summer/ winter pages.
- I want to sign up to the Newsletter so that I can be kept informed via email about offers or any new updates.

## Scope

- I have chosen simple features which align with content of my website: as its focus is on images and less text, giving users an easy way to learn about the sights and activities of Gothenburg. 
- While I have a limited description of things to do and see, I have provided direct links for more information. The intention behind this was to avoid overloading users with information and allows them to decide if they want to learn more about particular places or attractions.
- I have used mixed content of images, text and links.

## Structure

I decided to separate the website into four pages: the home page, summer page, winter page and sign up page (where the summer and winter pages are image-based).

## Skeleton

The website doesn't exactly match my original wireframes, i.e. the hero image on home and sign up pages is below navbar, navbar is with rounded shape on the right and left. I then decided to add buttons to summer and winter pages which lead to the sections on those pages.

- Home Page: <a href="assets/wireframes/HomePageWireframe.pdf" target="_blank" >Home</a>

- Summer Page: <a href="assets/wireframes/SummerWireframe.pdf" target="_blank" >Summer</a>

- Winter Page: <a href="assets/wireframes/WinterWireframe.pdf" target="_blank" >Winter</a>

- Sign Up Page: <a href="assets/wireframes/SignUpWireframe.pdf" target="_blank" >Sign Up</a>

## Surface

I wanted to use simple layout with rounded shapes to buttons, navbar elements & images; and as well colours of Gothenburg.


### Images
- Imagery is important, especially for image-based website. The hero image at the top of the home page is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention inviting to transition to the next pages.
In the meantime, the "summer" and "winter" pages mostly consist of images.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        - Main colors of the website are - blue, yellow and white. This colourscheme is consistant throughout all pages and is matching coat of arms of Gothenburg.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Risque font used for header elements. While Raleway font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case the font isn't loading. 
        Raleway is easy to read and eyecatching font for the navbar logo and navbar. Raleway is nicely spaced out and has shape that is perfectly matches the main headings font.
    -   #### Icons
        - Font Awesome was used for icons and they are psent on all pages: part of logo, next to links to summer & winter pages in the description on the home page and social links.

## Features

#### Navbar
- The navbar's background has been designed with a gradient-style fade. 
- Nav elements have rounded shapes - Home button is rounded on the left and Sign Up on the right. All of the nav elements are joined together.
- By creating a fixed-top navbar, I wanted the user to be able to easily navigate and move to the other page from wherever they are on it.
- On a mobile, the navbar is then collapsed to show the toggler which expands when clicked to display the nav elements in as a row - matching desktop and tablet versions.

#### Home
- Logo can be clicked on any page and it will take the user to home one.
- Contains the hero image of a night view showing a beautiful part of Gothenburg, perfectly syncing with the header colour scheme.
- For the headings a text-shadow declaration have been used.
- hr element in yellow is present underneath the article heading to emphasise it.
- Grid system used to create 4 columns: 2 of which are Summer and Winter pages description and links with icons to those; While the other 2 are images of summer and winter view of Gothenburg.

#### Summer and Winter
- Headings have are consitent with text-shadow declaration and hr element underneath the main heading like on home page.
- Buttons are below article (following the rounded shape of nav elements) leading to each section on the pages.
- Each section consist of images, description and links where user can learn more about chosen place or attraction.

#### Sign Up 
- Contains most of features from home page as well as form that needs to be filled out in order to get the voucher for booking anything on Tripadvisor or Booking.com 

#### Footer
- The same gradient-style fade has been aplied
- Contains links to partners
- Sign Up button (following the rounded shape of nav elements) can be clicked for user to go straight to sign up page
- Social media icons link to the pages/ videos about Gothenburg

### Features Left to Implement
- Functionality of the sign up form, which will learned in future modules.
