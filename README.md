## Code Institute - Milestone Project 1

 ### View the live project [here.](https://juliya91.github.io/instacity-goteborg/)

- The purpose of Instacity of Go:teborg is to introduce potential visitors to the hidden gems, scenic locations and exciting activities that can be experienced within Gothenburg; providing links to allow users to transition to other existing webpages where they can action their interests.  
Through considering this, I am ensuring that the website created will be optimised to meet the needs and wants of my target audience - encouraging repeat visitors.

## Overview

The idea has been inspired by Instagram as we're living in an increasingly digital age where the majority of users engage better with image-focused content, rather than large blocks of text.
 
## Description 

This project is a four-page website, of which the individual pages are: 'Home', 'Summer', 'Winter' and 'Sign Up'. The 'Summer' and 'Winter' pages are image-based and include minimal relevant information such as the location names, a little description and links under each image. 
The website is dedicated to Gothenburg, that is responsive on all devices. My goal for this project was to have user-friendly website that doesn't overload the visitor with big texts, where they can easily find all esential information about Gothenburg.

## UX  

## Strategy

This website is targeting all demographics who enjoys nature and looking for unique travel destinations. Gothenburg might not be the top place tourists normally visit, however it is full of adventorous things to do and breathaking views to see in summer as well as in winter.   

**Business Goals**

- To attract more users to sign up to receive offers for activities in Gothenburg.

- To have an easy intuative way to navigate through website and finding a necessary information.

- To provide a tailored information to activities providers that will result in higher number of tourists which will bring higher income for both us and partners.

**User Stories**

#### As a First Time User:

- I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site.
- I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
- I want the content to be user-friendly with engaging visual design.

#### As a Returning User: 

- I want to find more information about the city of Gothenburg.
- I want to easily find links to where I can book tickets for activities and events in Gothenburg.
- I want to find out about hot spots and picturesque places within the city.

#### As a Frequent User: 

- I want the content to remain consistent.
- I want the website's content to be regularly updated, so I can check to see if there are any new posts/pictures or locations added to summer/ winter pages.
- I want to sign up to the Newsletter so that I can be kept informed via email about offers or any new updates.

## Scope

- I have chosen simple features which align with content of my website: as its focus is on images and less text, giving users an easy way to learn about the sights and activities of Gothenburg. 
- While I have a limited description of things to do and see, I have provided direct links for more information. The intention behind this was to avoid overloading users with information and allows them to decide if they want to learn more about particular places or attractions.
- I have used mixed content of images, text and links.

## Structure

I decided to separate the website into four pages: the home page, summer page, winter page and sign up page (where the summer and winter pages are image-based).

## Skeleton

The website doesn't exactly match my original wireframes, i.e. the hero image on home and sign up pages is below navbar, navbar is with rounded shape on the right and left. I then decided to add buttons to summer and winter pages which lead to the sections on those pages.

- Home Page: <a href="assets/wireframes/home-wireframe.pdf" target="_blank" >Home</a>

- Summer Page: <a href="assets/wireframes/summer-wireframe.pdf" target="_blank" >Summer</a>

- Winter Page: <a href="assets/wireframes/winter-wireframe.pdf" target="_blank" >Winter</a>

- Sign Up Page: <a href="assets/wireframes/sign-up-wireframe.pdf" target="_blank" >Sign Up</a>

## Surface

I wanted to use simple layout with rounded shapes to buttons, navbar elements & images; and as well colours of Gothenburg.


### Images
- Imagery is important, especially for image-based website. The hero image at the top of the home page is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention inviting to transition to the next pages.
In the meantime, the "summer" and "winter" pages mostly consist of images.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        - Main colors of the website are - blue, yellow and white. This colourscheme is consistant throughout all pages and is matching coat of arms of Gothenburg.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Risque font used for header elements. While Raleway font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case the font isn't loading. 
        Raleway is easy to read and eyecatching font for the navbar logo and navbar. Raleway is nicely spaced out and has shape that is perfectly matches the main headings font.
    -   #### Icons
        - Font Awesome was used for icons and they are psent on all pages: part of logo, next to links to summer & winter pages in the description on the home page and social links.

## Features

#### Navbar
- The navbar's background has been designed with a gradient-style fade. 
- Nav elements have rounded shapes - Home button is rounded on the left and Sign Up on the right. All of the nav elements are joined together.
- By creating a fixed-top navbar, I wanted the user to be able to easily navigate and move to the other page from wherever they are on it.
- On a mobile, the navbar is then collapsed to show the toggler which expands when clicked to display the nav elements in as a row - matching desktop and tablet versions.

#### Home
- Logo can be clicked on any page and it will take the user to home one.
- Contains the hero image of a night view showing a beautiful part of Gothenburg, perfectly syncing with the header colour scheme.
- For the headings a text-shadow declaration have been used.
- hr element in yellow is present underneath the article heading to emphasise it.
- Grid system used to create 4 columns: 2 of which are Summer and Winter pages description and links with icons to those; While the other 2 are images of summer and winter view of Gothenburg.

#### Summer and Winter
- Headings have are consitent with text-shadow declaration and hr element underneath the main heading like on home page.
- Buttons are below article (following the rounded shape of nav elements) leading to each section on the pages.
- Each section consist of images, description and links where user can learn more about chosen place or attraction.

#### Sign Up 
- Contains most of features from home page as well as form that needs to be filled out in order to get the voucher for booking anything on Tripadvisor or Booking.com 

#### Footer
- The same gradient-style fade has been aplied
- Contains links to partners
- Sign Up button (following the rounded shape of nav elements) can be clicked for user to go straight to sign up page
- Social media icons link to the pages/ videos about Gothenburg

### Features Left to Implement
- Functionality of the sign up form, which will learned in future modules.
- Voucher code pop up once form is submited

## Technologies Used

#### Languages:
- [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)
- [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)

#### Libraries:
- [Bootstrap 4.2/4.5](https://getbootstrap.com/) - A mobile-first responsive library used to construct various parts of the website, including the Navbar, Sign Up Form, Grid System and Buttons.
- [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Raleway and Risque fonts

- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIn-_lgbiJ7QIVn4BQBh1X3Av6EAAYASAAEgL1XfD_BwE) - used for creating the wireframes

#### Version Control:
- [Github](https://github.com/) - Used to store the code and to deploy the website. 
- [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/) - Used as the primary version control IDE for development to further push and commit code to Gihub.

#### Other:
- [Code Institute Course Content](https://courses.codeinstitute.net/) - Main learning base as well as inspiration for curtain features.
- [ChromeDevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) - Used frequently to check layout, responsivness and any malfunctions.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - used for CSS coding tips.
- [StackOverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - used as a general resource for both styling and HTML tips.
- [HTML.am](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000049.htm) - Used for tip on how to link buttons to the sections.

## Testing

- Form testing: to check sign up form functionality, I tested it on different devices and browsers. For that I clicked the send button on the Sign Up page without any text in inputs to see it showing the desired response of 'Please fill out this field'.
- Links (Internal & External): internal links - when clicking on brand & logo it is leading user to home page from any page; links on Home page in the description of Summer & Winter pages are leading to the right page; buttons on Summer & Winter pages are leading to the right section. External links - used in the footer and under each image are leading user to the right website and for better UX I used traget:_blank, so it opens it in the new tab.
- Checked the website was mobile responsive on all pages through [Google Mobile Friendly Test](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly?utm_source=gws&utm_medium=onebox&utm_campaign=suit)

#### Bugs and Solutions

- Navbar menu was displaying vertically on mobile once clicked on navbar toggler, which didn't look presentable, I added display: flex; and flex-direction: row; to navbar toggler to display menu horizontally on mobile.
- Buttons on winter page were not centered as I put "col-4", but I changed from 3 buttons to 2. To solve that I changed it to "col-6" so it spreads out and centers.
- Images winter & summer pages were not displaying on deployed link, I had a mistake in img path (/assets/images/winter/got-haga-w.jpg). To rectify that I removed "/" before assets.
- Images on winter & summer pages on mobile version were not aligning, part of right side was covered as a result part of toggler was covered too. To solve this issue I used relative mesarument for the width of images on those pages (changed to 100% width).
- On sign up page on mobile version choice of interest checkboxes were partly covered, which caused toggler to not be visible. I decided to have checkboxes displaying vertically on mobile version instead of horizontally like on desktop version. To achieve this a changed "d-flex" to "d-md-flex" in the "div" that wrappes the checkboxes and heading for choise of interest.

#### Testing User Stories

#### As a First Time User:

**"I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site."**
> *The moment the user opens the website they can see the brand and logo - Instacity Go:teborg at the top and hero image of the city below the header, which immediately indicates the purpose of the website.
Subsquently, scrolling down you can find a description of what to expect and the following pages.*

**"I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content."**

**"I want the content to be user-friendly with engaging visual design."**
> *Main colours for the header and footer of blue, yellow and white creates a visually pleasing design, paying homage to Gothenburg's coat of arms colours. 
The rest of the content on the otherhand, has a minimalistic aesthetic, with concise, catchy text, a few links and mostly images, which are easy to follow and are engaging.*


#### As a Returning User:

**"I want to find more information about the city of Gothenburg."**
> *The home page has a small general description of Gothenburg at the top and below the user can find out about Summer and Winter in the city. 
Once advancing to these respective pages - the images and descriptions correlating to each season, gives the user an understanding what to expect when visit Gothenburg in those times of the year.*

**"I want the website's content to be regularly updated, so I can check to see if there are any new posts/pictures or locations added to summer/ winter pages."**
> *Weren't able to test these two as the website is newly built. However, in the future I would like to update the website by adding more places to visit in Gothenburg and perhaps new features.

**"I want to sign up to the Newsletter so that I can be kept informed via email about offers or any new updates."**
> *Sign up form with choices of interest (accessible via ticking) is present on the sign up page, which states that by signing up the user can receive a voucher and tailored offers.*

## Deployment

- Once I had set up my account Github, I created a new repository by clicking "+" next to my profile avatar and choosing "New repository". To create this project and all follow along projects, I used the Code Institute's student [template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).
- Once added a Gitpod extention to a browser, on GitHub repository click on the green "Gitpod" button which will redirect to [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/)
- Gitpod, an IDE used to write all the code and this README file for this project.
- After every significant change and edition to the project it was saved, commited and pushed to Github where it is stored in a [repository](https://github.com/Juliya91/instacity-goteborg)
- Under "Settings", I scrolled down to Github Pages and selected "Master Branch".
- Once this was selected, the project was pushed to Github pages and the URL is then displayed. That URL gets updated automatically each time I made a change on Gitpod and pushed it to GitHub.
